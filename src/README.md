# Voxel Engine Remake

C++ remake of the Java voxel engine which I wrote when I was 16 years old.
It uses the OpenGL API and features many post processing effects, including
Bloom, FXAA, a custom SSAO implementation and more. It is a lot more efficient,
due to the use of advanced techniques like greedy meshing, and the beginning
of the multiplayer functionality is done.
